<h1>About JACT</h1>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The <em>Journal of Albanian Conspiracy Theories</em> 
exists to document, dissect, and reimagine Albanian history through the prism of conspiratorial thought. Our scope embraces every possible domain --- from astrophysics or climate change, from foreign policy and the covert mechanics of international politics, to the subtle manipulations of media narratives, the occult, the hidden economies of cheese-making, or the coded messages buried in Balkan film studies. If it carries the taste of conspiracy, it belongs within our pages.<br>

JACT is broad in its reach yet narrow in its obsession: the Albanian experience as seen through suspicion, intrigue, and alternative historiography. We are generous in our admissions, yet exacting in our expectations; careful in sourcing, yet careless in accepting the possibility that the improbable may be true.<br>

We welcome the earnest and the eccentric, the meticulous and the speculative, so long as they serve the central mission: to keep alive the conspiratorial imagination in all its Albanian forms.<br>

Publication fees are set at 10\,000~EUR if you believe your work <it>must</it> appear in our pages --- or 0 EUR if the editors believe it <it>must</it>.
